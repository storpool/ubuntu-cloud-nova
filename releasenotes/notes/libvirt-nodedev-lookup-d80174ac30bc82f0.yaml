    Since the 16.0.0 (Pike) release, nova has collected NIC feature
    flags via libvirt. To look up the NIC feature flags for a whitelisted
    PCI device the nova libvirt driver computed the libvirt nodedev name
    by rendering a format string using the netdev name associated with
    the interface and its current MAC address. In some environments the
    libvirt nodedev list can become out of sync with the current MAC address
    assigned to a netdev and as a result the nodedev look up can fail.
    Nova now uses PCI addresses, rather than MAC addresses, to look up these
    PCI network devices.
