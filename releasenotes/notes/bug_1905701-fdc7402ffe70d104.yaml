    The libvirt virt driver will no longer attempt to fetch volume
    encryption metadata or the associated secret key when attaching ``LUKSv1``
    encrypted volumes if a libvirt secret already exists on the host.

    This resolves `bug 1905701`_ where instances with ``LUKSv1`` encrypted
    volumes could not be restarted automatically by the ``nova-compute``
    service after a host reboot when the
    ``[DEFAULT]/resume_guests_state_on_host_boot`` configurable was enabled.
