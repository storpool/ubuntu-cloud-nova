    The Nova policies have been modified to isolate the system and project
    level APIs policy. This means system users will be allowed to perform
    the operation on system level resources and will not to allowed any
    operation on project level resources. Project Level APIs operation will be
    performed by the project scoped users.
    Currently, nova supports:

    * ``system admin``
    * ``project admin``
    * ``project member``
    * ``project reader``

    For the details on what changed from the existing policy, please refer the
    `RBAC new guidelines`_. We have implemented only phase-1
    `RBAC new guidelines`_.
    Currently, scope checks and new defaults are disabled by default. You can
    enable them by switching the below config option in ``nova.conf`` file::

      [oslo_policy]
      enforce_new_defaults=True
      enforce_scope=True

    Please refer `Policy New Defaults`_ for detail about policy new defaults
    and migration plan.
