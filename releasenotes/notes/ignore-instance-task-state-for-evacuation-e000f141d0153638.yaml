    If compute service is down in source node and user try to stop
    instance, instance gets stuck at powering-off, hence evacuation fails with
    msg: Cannot 'evacuate' instance <instance-id> while it is in
    task_state powering-off.
    It is now possible for evacuation to ignore the vm task state.
