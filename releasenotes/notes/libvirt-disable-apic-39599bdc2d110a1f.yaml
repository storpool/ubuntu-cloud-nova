    Linux guest images that have known kernel bugs related to virtualized apic
    initialization previously would sporadically hang. For images where the
    kernel cannot be upgraded, a ``[workarounds]`` config option has been
    introduced:

    ``[workarounds]libvirt_disable_apic``

    This option is primarily intended for CI and development clouds as a bridge
    for operators to mitigate the issue while they work with their upstream
    image vendors.
