    The scheduler can now verify if the requested networks or the port are
    related to Neutron `routed networks`_ with some specific segments to use.
    In this case, the routed networks prefilter will require the related
    aggregates to be reported in Placement, so only hosts within the asked
    aggregates would be accepted.
    In order to support this behaviour, operators need to set the
    ``[scheduler]/query_placement_for_routed_network_aggregates`` configuration
    option which defaults to ``False``.
