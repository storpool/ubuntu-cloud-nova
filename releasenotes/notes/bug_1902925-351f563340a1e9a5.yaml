    When upgrading compute services from Ussuri to Victoria each by one, the
    Compute RPC API was pinning to 5.11 (either automatically or by using
    the specific rpc version in the option) but when rebuilding an instance,
    a TypeError was raised as an argument was not provided. This error is
    fixed by `bug 1902925`_.
