    A few of the APIs return code was not consistent for the operations/
    features not implemented or supported. It was returned as 403, 400, or
    409 (for Operation Not Supported For SEV , Operation Not Supported For
    VTPM cases). Now we have made it consistent and return 400 always when
    any operations/features are not implemented or supported.
