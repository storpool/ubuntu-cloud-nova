upgrade:
  - |
    The ``bandwidth`` field has been removed from the ``instance.exists`` and
    ``instance.update`` versioned notifications and the version for both
    notifications has been bumped to 2.0. The ``bandwidth`` field was only
    relevant when the XenAPI virt driver was in use, but this driver was
    removed in the Victoria (22.0.0) release and the field has been a no-op
    since.
