    When using the libvirt virt driver with the QEMU or KVM backends, instances
    will now be created with the *vmcoreinfo* feature enabled by default. This
    creates a fw_cfg entry for a guest to store dump details, necessary to
    process kernel dump with KASLR enabled and providing additional kernel
    details. For more information, refer to the `libvirt`__ documentation.
