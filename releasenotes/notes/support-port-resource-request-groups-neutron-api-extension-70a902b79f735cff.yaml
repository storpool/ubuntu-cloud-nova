features:
  - |
    Added support for ports with minimum guaranteed packet rate QoS policy
    rules. Support is provided for all server operations including cold
    migration, resize, interface attach/detach, etc.
    This feature required adding support for the
    ``port-resource-request-groups`` neutron API extension, as ports with such
    a QoS policy will have multiple rules, each requesting resources.
    For more details see the  `admin guide`_.
  - |
    The ``nova-manage placement heal_allocations`` `CLI`_ now allows
    regenerating the placement allocation of servers with ports using minimum
    guaranteed packet rate QoS policy rules.
