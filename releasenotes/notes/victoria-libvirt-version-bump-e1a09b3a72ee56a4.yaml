    The minimum required version of libvirt used by the `nova-compute` service
    is now 5.0.0. The minimum required version of QEMU used by the
    `nova-compute` service is now 4.0.0. Failing to meet these minimum versions
    when using the libvirt compute driver will result in the `nova-compute`
    service not starting.
