    Support for automatically retrying all database interactions by configuring
    the ``[database] use_db_reconnect`` config option has been removed. This
    behavior was only ever supported for interactions with the main database
    and was generally not necessary as a number of lookups were already
    explicitly wrapped in retries. The ``[database] use_db_reconnect`` option
    is provided by oslo.db and will now be ignored by nova.
