    Instances with hardware offloaded ovs ports no longer lose connectivity
    after failed live migrations. The driver.rollback_live_migration_at_source
    function is no longer called during during pre_live_migration rollback
    which previously resulted in connectivity loss following a failed live
    migration. See `Bug 1944619`_ for more details.
