    During the havana cycle it was discovered that eventlet
    monkey patching of greendns broke ipv6.

    Since then nova has been disabling eventlet monkey patching
    of greendns. Eventlet adressed the ipv6 limitation in v0.17
    with the introduction of python 3 support in 2015. Nova
    however continued to disable it, which can result i slow dns
    queries blocking the entire nova api or other binary
    because socket.getaddrinfo becomes a blocking call into glibc
    see: https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1964149 for
    more details.
