    When using the *libvirt* compute driver, the **libguestfs** package is now
    **required** for file injection, if you are supporting that in your cloud
    (see the ``[libvirt]/inject_partition`` config option).

    Previously, if the libguestfs package was not installed, the nova-compute
    service would fallback to mounting to the local compute host file system
    which is a security exposure. This has been discussed for years in several
    forums:

    http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2014-September/046764.html

    http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2016-July/098703.html

    http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2016-November/107233.html

    Furthermore, the `2.57 compute REST API microversion`_ deprecated the use
    of personality files for file injection. For more history on deprecating
    file injection, see the `spec`__.

    There are some known caveats with this:

    * If running on s390x, you will need libguestfs >= 1.37.14.
    * At this time, FreeBSD does not have a libguestfs package, therefore
      file injection cannot be supported with the libvirt driver on a FreeBSD
      compute host.
    * ``[libvirt]/virt_type`` config option values other than ``kvm`` or
      ``qemu`` may be impacted, like ``lxc``, where libguestfs was not
      previously required.
