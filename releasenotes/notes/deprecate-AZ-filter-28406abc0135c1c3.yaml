deprecations:
  - |
    The ``AvailabilityZoneFilter`` scheduler filters is now deprecated
    for removal in a future release. The functionality of the
    ``AvailabilityZoneFilter`` has been replaced by the
    ``map_az_to_placement_aggregate`` pre-filter which was introduced in
    18.0.0 (Rocky). This pre-filter is now enabled by default and will be
    mandatory in a future release.
upgrades:
  - |
    The ``AvailabilityZoneFilter``  has been removed from the default
    ``[scheduler] enabled_filters`` list. The ``AvailabilityZoneFilter``
    is replaced by an optional placement pre-filter which is enabled by
    ``[scheduler] query_placement_for_availability_zone``.
    The pre-filter is now enabled by default. If you choose to disable the
    AZ pre-filter, you will need to re-add ``AvailabilityZoneFilter`` to the
    ``[scheduler] enabled_filters`` config value.
