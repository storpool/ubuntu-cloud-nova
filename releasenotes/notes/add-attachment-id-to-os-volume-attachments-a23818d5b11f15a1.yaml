    Microversion 2.89 has been introduced and will include the
    ``attachment_id`` of a volume attachment, ``bdm_uuid`` of the block device
    mapping record and removes the duplicate ``id`` from the responses for ``GET
    /servers/{server_id}/os-volume_attachments`` and ``GET
    /servers/{server_id}/os-volume_attachments/{volume_id}``.
