    Added support for off-path networking backends where devices exposed to the
    hypervisor host are managed remotely (which is the case, for example, with
    various SmartNIC DPU devices). ``VNIC_TYPE_REMOTE_MANAGED`` ports can now
    be added to Nova instances as soon as all compute nodes are upgraded to
    the new compute service version. In order to use this feature, VF PCI/PCIe
    devices need to be tagged as ``remote_managed: "true"` in the Nova config
    in the ``passthrough_whitelist`` option.

    This feature relies on Neutron being upgraded to the corresponding release
    of OpenStack and having an appropriate backend capable of binding
    ``VNIC_TYPE_REMOTE_MANAGED`` ports (at the time of writing, ML2 with the OVN
    ML2 mechanism driver is the only supported backend, see the Neutron
    documentation for more details).

    Note that the PCI devices (VFs or, alternatively, their PF) must have a
    valid PCI Vital Product Data (VPD) with a serial number present in it for
    this feature to work properly. Also note that only VFs can be tagged as
    ``remote_managed: "true"`` and they cannot be used for legacy SR-IOV
    use-cases.

    Nova operations on instances with ``VNIC_TYPE_REMOTE_MANAGED`` ports
    follow the same logic as the operations on direct SR-IOV ports.

    This feature is only supported with the Libvirt driver.
