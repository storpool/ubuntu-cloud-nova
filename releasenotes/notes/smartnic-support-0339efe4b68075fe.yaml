    Add support for smartnic via Cyborg device profiles in Neutron ports with
    vnic type ``accelerator-direct``. When such port is used Cyborg will
    manage the smartnic and Nova will pass through the smartnic VF to the
    server. Note that while vnic type ``accelerator-direct-physical`` also
    exists in Neutron it is not yet supported by Nova and the server create
    request will fail with such port.
