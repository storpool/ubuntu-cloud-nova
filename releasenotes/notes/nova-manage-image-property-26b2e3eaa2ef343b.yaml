    New ``nova-manage image_property`` commands have been added to help update
    instance image properties that have become invalidated by a change of
    instance machine type.

    * The ``nova-manage image_property show`` command can be used to show the
      current stored image property value for a given instance and property.

    * The ``nova-manage image_property set`` command can be used to update the
      stored image properties stored in the database for a given instance and
      image properties.

    For more detail on command usage, see the machine type documentation:
