    When the tempest test coverage was added for resize and cold migrate
    with neutron ports having QoS minimum bandwidth policy rules we
    discovered that the cross cell resize code path cannot handle such ports.
    See bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1907522 for details. A fix
    was implemented that makes sure that Nova falls back to same-cell resize if
    the server has such ports.
