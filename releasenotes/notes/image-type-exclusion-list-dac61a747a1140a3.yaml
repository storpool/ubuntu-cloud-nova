    A ``[compute]image_type_exclusion_list`` configuration option was
    added to remove supported image types from being advertised by a
    compute node as supported. This is to be used in conjunction with
    ``[scheduler]query_placement_for_image_type_support`` to prevent
    instances from booting on a compute node with a given image type,
    even if the underlying hypervisor supports it.
