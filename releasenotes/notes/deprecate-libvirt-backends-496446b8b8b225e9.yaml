deprecations:
  - |
    Support for the ``xen``, ``uml``, ``lxc`` and ``parallels`` libvirt
    backends, configured via the ``[libvirt] virt_type`` config option, has
    been deprecated. None of these drivers have upstream testing and the
    ``xen`` and ``uml`` backends specifically have never been considered
    production ready. With this change, only the ``kvm`` and ``qemu`` backends
    are considered supported when using the libvirt virt driver.
