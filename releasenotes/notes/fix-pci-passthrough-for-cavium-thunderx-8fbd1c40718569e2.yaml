    On some hardware platforms, an SR-IOV virtual function for a NIC port may
    exist without being associated with a parent physical function that has
    an assocatied netdev. In such a case the the PF interface name lookup
    will fail. As the ``PciDeviceNotFoundById`` exception was not handled
    this would prevent the nova compute agent from starting on affected
    hardware. See: https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1915255 for more
    details. This edgecase has now been addressed, however, features
    that depend on the PF name such as minimum bandwidth based QoS cannot
    be supported on these platforms.
