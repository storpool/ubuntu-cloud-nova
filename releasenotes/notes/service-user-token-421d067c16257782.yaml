    Configuration of service user tokens is now **required** for all Nova services
    to ensure security of block-storage volume data.

    All Nova configuration files must configure the ``[service_user]`` section as
    described in the `documentation`__.

    See https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/2004555 for more details.
