    Adds a workaround that allows one to disable hypervisor
    version-check on live migration.  This workaround option can be
    useful in certain scenarios when upgrading.  E.g. if you want to
    relocate all instances off a compute node due to an emergency
    hardware issue, and you only have another old compute node ready at
    the time.

    To enable this, use the config attribute
    ``[workarounds]skip_hypervisor_version_check_on_lm=True`` in
    ``nova.conf``.  The option defaults to ``False``.
