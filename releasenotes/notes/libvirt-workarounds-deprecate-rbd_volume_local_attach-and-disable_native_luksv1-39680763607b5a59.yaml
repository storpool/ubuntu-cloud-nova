deprecations:
  - |
    The ``[workarounds]rbd_volume_local_attach`` and
    ``[workarounds]disable_native_luksv1`` options have been deprecated as of
    the 23.0.0 release ahead of removal in the future as the underlying
    ``libgcrypt`` performance regressions that prompted their introduction have
    been resolved.

    Any remaining users of these workarounds should plan to disable these
    workarounds as soon as possible. Note that this requires that any instances
    on compute hosts using the workaround be shutdown ahead of the value of the
    workaround changing, before being restarted.
