    Support was added to specify a port NUMA affinity policy
    for SR-IOV ports. This feature allows users to set a NUMA affinity
    policy between a neutron port and a NUMA guest's CPUs and memory.
    This feature supports the same policies as the existing VM Scoped
    PCI NUMA Affinity policy and take precedence over the
    flavor and image policy. This allows operators to set a default
    affinity policy in the flavor or image while end users can
    express a more granular affinity policy.
    To use this feature operators must enable the
    ``port-numa-affinity-policy`` neutron extension and configure the
    service plugin in neutron. By default the extension
    is listed as available but is not enabled.
