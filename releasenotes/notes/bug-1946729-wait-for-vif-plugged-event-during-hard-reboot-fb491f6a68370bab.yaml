    The libvirt virt driver in Nova implements power on and hard reboot by
    destroying the domain first and unpluging the vifs then recreating the
    domain and replugging the vifs. However nova does not wait for the
    network-vif-plugged event before unpause the domain. This can cause
    the domain to start running and requesting IP via DHCP before the
    networking backend has finished plugging the vifs. The config option
    [workarounds]wait_for_vif_plugged_event_during_hard_reboot has been added,
    defaulting to an empty list, that can be used to ensure that the libvirt
    driver waits for the network-vif-plugged event for vifs with specific
    ``vnic_type`` before it unpauses the domain during hard reboot. This should
    only be used if the deployment uses a networking backend that sends such
    event for the given ``vif_type`` at vif plug time. The ml2/ovs and the
    networking-odl Neutron backend is known to send plug time events for ports
    with ``normal`` ``vnic_type``.  For more information see
