    The 22.0.0 release includes many new features and bug fixes. Please be
    sure to read the upgrade section which describes the required actions to
    upgrade your cloud from 21.0.0 (Ussuri) to 22.0.0 (Victoria).

    There are a few major changes worth mentioning. This is not an exhaustive
    list:

    - The latest Compute API microversion supported for Victoria is v2.87.
      No new microversions were added during this cycle but you can find all
      of them in the `REST API Version History`__ page.

      .. __: https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/reference/api-microversion-history.html

    - Support for a new ``mixed`` `flavor CPU allocation policy`__ that allows
      both pinned and floating CPUs within the same instance.

      .. __: https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/user/flavors.html

    - Custom Placement resource inventories and traits can now be described
      using a single `providers configuration file`__.

      .. __: https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/managing-resource-providers.html

    - Glance multistore configuration with multiple RBD backends is now
      supported within Nova for libvirt RBD-backed images using
      ``[libvirt]/images_rbd_glance_store_name`` configuration option.

    - An `emulated Virtual Trusted Platform Module`__ can be exposed to
      instances running on a ``libvirt`` hypervisor with ``qemu`` or ``kvm``
      backends.

      .. __: https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/emulated-tpm.html

    - Support for the ``xen``, ``uml``, ``lxc`` and ``parallels`` libvirt
      backends has been deprecated.

    - ``XenAPI`` virt driver has been removed, including the related
      configuration options.

    - ``VMWare`` virt driver is now supported again in Victoria after being
      deprecated during the Ussuri release, as testing issues have been
      addressed.
