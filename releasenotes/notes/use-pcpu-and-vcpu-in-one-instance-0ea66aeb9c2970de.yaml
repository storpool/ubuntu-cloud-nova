    Add the ``mixed`` instance CPU allocation policy for instance mixing with
    both ``PCPU`` and ``VCPU`` resources. This is useful for applications that
    wish to schedule the CPU intensive workload on the ``PCPU`` and the other
    workloads on ``VCPU``. The mixed policy avoids the necessity of making
    all instance CPUs to be pinned CPUs, as a result, reduces the consuption
    of pinned CPUs and increases the instance density.

    Extend the real-time instance with the ``mixed`` CPU allocation policy. In
    comparing with ``dedicated`` policy real-time instance, the non-real-time
    CPUs are not longer required to be pinned on dedicated host CPUs, but
    float on a range of host CPUs sharing with other instances.
  - |
    Add the extra spec ``hw:cpu_dedicated_mask`` to set the pinned CPUs for
    the mixed instance. This is a core mask and can be used to include or
    exclude CPUs. Any core not included or explicitly excluded is treated as a
    shared CPU.

    Export instance pinned CPU list through the ``dedicated_cpus`` section in
    the metadata service API.
