    The ``[vnc] keymap`` and ``[spice] keymap`` configuration options, first
    deprecated in 18.0.0 (Rocky), have now been removed.  The VNC option
    affected the libvirt and VMWare virt drivers, while the SPICE option only
    affected libvirt. For the libvirt driver, configuring these options
    resulted in lossy keymap conversions for the given graphics method.  Users
    can replace this host-level configuration with guest-level configuration.
    This requires noVNC 1.0.0 or greater, which provides support for QEMU's
    Extended Key Event messages. Refer to `bug #1682020`__ and the `QEMU RFB
    pull request`__ for more information.

    For the VMWare driver, only the VNC option applied. However, the
    ``[vmware] vnc_keymap`` option was introduce in 18.0.0 (Rocky) and can be
    used to replace ``[vnc] keymap``.
