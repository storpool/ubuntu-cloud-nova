    `Bug #1829479 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1829479>`_: Now
    deleting a nova-compute service removes allocations of successfully
    evacuated instances. This allows the associated resource provider to be
    deleted automatically even if the nova-compute service cannot recover after
    all instances on the node have been successfully evacuated.
