    Extra sortings were added to numa_fit_instance_to_host function
    to balance usage of hypervisor's NUMA cells. Hypervisor's NUMA
    cells with more free resources (CPU, RAM, PCI if requested)
    will be used first (spread strategy) when configuration option
    ``packing_host_numa_cells_allocation_strategy`` was set to False.
    Default value of ``packing_host_numa_cells_allocation_strategy``
    option is set to True which leads to packing strategy usage.
