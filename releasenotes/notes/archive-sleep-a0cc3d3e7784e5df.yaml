    A ``--sleep`` option has been added to the ``nova-manage db
    archive_deleted_rows`` CLI. When this command is run with the
    ``--until-complete`` option, the process will archive rows in batches
    in a tight loop, which can cause problems in busy environments where
    the aggressive archiving interferes with other requests trying to write
    to the database. The ``--sleep`` option can be used to specify a time to
    sleep between batches of rows while archiving with ``--until-complete``,
    allowing the process to be throttled.
