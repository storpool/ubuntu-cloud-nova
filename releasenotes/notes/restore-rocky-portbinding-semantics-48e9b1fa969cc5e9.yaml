    In the Rocky (18.0.0) release support was added to nova to use neutron's
    multiple port binding feature when the binding-extended API extension
    is available. In the Train (20.0.0) release the SR-IOV live migration
    feature broke the semantics of the vifs field in the ``migration_data``
    object that signals if the new multiple port binding workflow should
    be used by always populating it even when the ``binding-extended`` API
    extension is not present. This broke live migration for any deployment
    that did not support the optional ``binding-extended`` API extension.
    The Rocky behavior has now been restored enabling live migration
    using the single port binding workflow when multiple port bindings
    are not available.
