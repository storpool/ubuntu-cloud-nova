    The libvirt driver now allows explicitly disabling CPU flags for
    guests via the ``[libvirt]cpu_model_extra_flags`` config attribute.
    This is possible via a ``+`` / ``-`` notation, where if you specify
    a CPU flag prefixed with a ``+`` sign (without quotes), it will be
    enabled for the guest, while a prefix of ``-`` will disable it.  If
    neither ``+`` nor ``-`` is specified, the CPU flag will be enabled,
    which is the default behaviour.

    Refer to the ``[libvirt]cpu_model_extra_flags`` documentation for
    more information.
