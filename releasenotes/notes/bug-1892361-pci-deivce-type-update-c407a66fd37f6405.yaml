    Fixes `bug 1892361`_ in which the pci stat pools are not updated when an
    existing device is enabled with SRIOV capability. Restart of nova-compute
    service updates the pci device type from type-PCI to type-PF but the pools
    still maintain the device type as type-PCI. And so the PF is considered for
    allocation to instance that requests vnic_type=direct. With this fix, the
    pci device type updates are detected and the pci stat pools are updated
    properly.
