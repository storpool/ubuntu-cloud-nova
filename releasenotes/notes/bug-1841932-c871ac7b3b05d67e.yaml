    Add support for the ``hw:hide_hypervisor_id`` extra spec. This is an
    alias for the ``hide_hypervisor_id`` extra spec, which was not
    compatible with the ``AggregateInstanceExtraSpecsFilter`` scheduler
    filter. See
    `bug 1841932 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1841932>`_ for more
    details.
