    Minimizes a race condition window when using the ``ironic`` virt driver
    where the data generated for the Resource Tracker may attempt to compare
    potentially stale instance information with the latest known baremetal
    node information. While this doesn't completely prevent nor resolve the
    underlying race condition identified in
    `bug 1841481 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1841481>`_,
    this change allows Nova to have the latest state information, as opposed
    to state information which may be out of date due to the time which it may
    take to retrieve the status from Ironic. This issue was most observable
    on baremetal clusters with several thousand physical nodes.
