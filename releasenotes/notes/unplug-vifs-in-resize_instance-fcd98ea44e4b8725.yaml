    Support for cold migration and resize between hosts with different network backends
    was previously incomplete. If the os-vif plugin for all network backends available
    in the cloud are not installed on all nodes unplugging will fail during confirming
    the resize. The issue is caused by the VIF unplug that happened during the resize
    confirm action on the source host when the original backend information of the VIF
    was not available. The fix moved the unplug to happen during the resize action
    when such information is still available. See `bug #1895220`_ for more details.
