    Add VPD capability parsing support when a PCI VPD capability is exposed
    via node device XML in Libvirt. The XML data from Libvirt is parsed and
    formatted into PCI device JSON dict that is sent to Nova API and is stored
    in the extra_info column of a PciDevice.

    The code gracefully handles the lack of the capability since it is optional
    or Libvirt may not support it in a particular release.

    A serial number is extracted from PCI VPD of network devices (if present)
    and is sent to Neutron in port updates.

    Libvirt supports parsing the VPD capability from PCI/PCIe devices and
    exposing it via nodedev XML as of 7.9.0.
