    The minimum required version of libvirt used by the `nova-compute` service
    is now 6.0.0. The next minimum required version to be used in a future
    release is 7.0.0.

    The minimum required version of QEMU used by the `nova-compute` service is
    now 4.2.0. The next minimum required version to be used in a future release
    is 5.2.0.

    Failing to meet these minimum versions when using the libvirt compute
    driver will result in the `nova-compute` service not starting.
