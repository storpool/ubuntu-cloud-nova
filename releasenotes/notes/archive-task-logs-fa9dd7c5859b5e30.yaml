    A ``--task-log`` option has been added to the ``nova-manage db
    archive_deleted_rows`` CLI. When ``--task-log`` is specified, ``task_log``
    table records will be archived while archiving the database. The
    ``--task-log`` option works in conjunction with ``--before`` if operators
    desire archiving only records that are older than ``<date>``. The
    ``updated_at`` field is used by ``--task-log --before <date>`` to determine
    the age of a ``task_log`` record for archival.

    The ``task_log`` database table contains instance usage audit records if
    ``nova-compute`` has been configured with ``[DEFAULT]instance_usage_audit =
    True``. This will be the case if OpenStack Telemetry is being used in the
    deployment, as the option causes Nova to generate audit notifications that
    Telemetry consumes from the message bus.

    Usage data can also be later retrieved by calling the
    ``/os-instance_usage_audit_log`` REST API [1].

    Historically, there has been no way to delete ``task_log`` table records
    other than manual database modification. Because of this, ``task_log``
    records could pile up over time and operators are forced to perform manual
    steps to periodically truncate the ``task_log`` table.
