features:
  - |
    The 2.90 microversion has been added. This microversion allows users to
    specify a requested hostname to be configured for the instance metadata
    when creating an instance (``POST /servers``), updating an instance
    (``PUT /servers/{id}``), or rebuilding an instance
    (``POST /servers/{server_id}/action (rebuild)``). When specified, this
    hostname replaces the hostname that nova auto-generates from the instance
    display name. As with the auto-generated hostnames, a service such as
    ``cloud-init`` can automatically configure the hostname in the guest OS
    using this information retrieved from the metadata service.

    In addition, starting with the 2.90 microversion, the
    ``OS-EXT-SRV-ATTR:hostname`` field is now returned for all users.
    Previously this was restricted to admin users.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``os_compute_api:os-extended-server-attributes`` policy controls
    which users a number of server extended attributes are shown to.
    Configuring visiblity of the ``OS-EXT-SRV-ATTR:hostname`` attribute via
    this policy has now been deprecated and will be removed in a future
    release. Upon removal, this attribute will be shown for all users
    regardless of policy configuration.
