    New ``[glance]/enable_rbd_download`` config option was introduced.
    The option allows for the configuration of direct downloads
    of Ceph hosted glance images into the libvirt image cache via rbd when
    ``[glance]/enable_rbd_download= True`` and ``[glance]/rbd_user``,
    ``[glance]/rbd_pool``, ``[glance]/rbd_connect_timeout``,
    ``[glance]/rbd_ceph_conf`` are correctly configured.
