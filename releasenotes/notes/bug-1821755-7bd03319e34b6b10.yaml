    Improved detection of anti-affinity policy violation when performing live
    and cold migrations. Most of the violations caused by race conditions due
    to performing concurrent live or cold migrations should now be addressed
    by extra checks in the compute service. Upon detection, cold migration
    operations are automatically rescheduled, while live migrations have two
    checks and will be rescheduled if detected by the first one, otherwise the
    live migration will fail cleanly and revert the instance state back to its
    previous value.
