    A vulnerability in the console proxies (novnc, serial, spice) that allowed
    open redirection has been `patched`_. The novnc, serial, and spice console
    proxies are implemented as websockify servers and the request handler
    inherits from the python standard SimpleHTTPRequestHandler. There is a
    `known issue`_ in the SimpleHTTPRequestHandler which allows open redirects
    by way of URLs in the following format::

      http://vncproxy.my.domain.com//example.com/%2F..

    which if visited, will redirect a user to example.com.

    The novnc, serial, and spice console proxies will now reject requests that
    pass a redirection URL beginning with "//" with a 400 Bad Request.
