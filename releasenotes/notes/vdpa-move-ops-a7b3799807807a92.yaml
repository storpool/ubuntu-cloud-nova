    When vDPA was first introduced move operations were implemented in the code
    but untested either in a real environment or in functional tests. Due to
    this gap nova elected to block move operations for instance with vDPA
    devices. All move operations except for live migration have now been tested
    and found to indeed work so the API blocks have now been removed and
    functional tests introduced. Other operations such as suspend and
    live migration require code changes to support and will be enabled as new
    features in the future.
