    To fix `device detach issues`__ in the libvirt driver the detach logic has
    been changed from a sleep based retry loop to waiting for libvirt domain
    events. During this change we also introduced two new config options to
    allow fine tuning the retry logic. For details see the description of the
    new ``[libvirt]device_detach_attempts`` and
    ``[libvirt]device_detach_timeout`` config options.
