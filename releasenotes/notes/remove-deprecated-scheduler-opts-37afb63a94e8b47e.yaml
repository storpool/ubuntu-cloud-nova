    - ``[DEFAULT] scheduler_host_subset_size`` (now
      ``[scheduler] host_subset_size``)
    - ``[DEFAULT] max_io_ops_per_host`` (now
      ``[scheduler] max_io_ops_per_host``)
    - ``[DEFAULT] max_instances_per_host`` (now
      ``[scheduler] max_instances_per_host``)
    - ``[DEFAULT] scheduler_tracks_instance_changes`` (now
      ``[scheduler] track_instance_changes``)
    - ``[DEFAULT] scheduler_available_filters`` (now
