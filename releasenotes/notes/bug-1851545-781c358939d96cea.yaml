    `Bug 1851545 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1851545>`_, wherein
    unshelving an instance with SRIOV Neutron ports did not update the port
    binding's ``pci_slot`` and could cause libvirt PCI conflicts, has been
    fixed.

    .. important:: Constraints in the fix's implementation mean that it only
      applies to instances booted **after** it has been applied. Existing
      instances will still experience bug 1851545 after being shelved and
      unshelved, even with the fix applied.
