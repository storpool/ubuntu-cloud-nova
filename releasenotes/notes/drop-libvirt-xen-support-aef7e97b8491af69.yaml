upgrade:
  - |
    Support for the libvirt+xen hypervisor model has been removed. This has
    not been validated in some time and was not supported.
  - |
    The ``[libvirt] xen_hvmloader_path`` config option has been removed. This
    was only used with the libvirt+xen hypervisor, which is no longer
    supported.
