    Added params ``[libvirt]/rbd_destroy_volume_retries``, defaulting to 12,
    and ``[libvirt]/rbd_destroy_volume_retry_interval``, defaulting to 5, that
    Nova will use when trying to remove a volume from Ceph in a retry loop
    that combines these parameters together. Thus, maximum elapsing time is by
    default 60 seconds.

    Nova tries to remove a volume from Ceph in a retry loop of 10 attempts at
    1 second intervals, totaling 10 seconds overall - which, due to 30 second
    ceph watcher timeout, might result in intermittent object removal failures
    on Ceph side (`bug 1856845`_). Setting default values for
    ``[libvirt]/rbd_destroy_volume_retries`` to 12 and
    ``[libvirt]/rbd_destroy_volume_retry_interval`` to 5, now gives Ceph
    reasonable amount of time to complete the operation successfully.
