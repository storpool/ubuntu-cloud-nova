    The 2.88 API microversion has been added. This microversion removes a
    number of fields have been removed from the ``GET /os-hypervisors/detail``
    (detailed list) and ``GET /os-hypervisors/{hypervisor_id}`` (show) APIs::

    - ``current_workload``
    - ``cpu_info``
    - ``vcpus``
    - ``vcpus_used``
    - ``free_disk_gb``
    - ``local_gb``
    - ``local_gb_used``
    - ``disk_available_least``
    - ``free_ram_mb``
    - ``memory_mb``
    - ``memory_mb_used``
    - ``running_vms``

    The fields have been removed as the information they provided was
    frequently misleading or outright wrong, and more accurate information can
    now be queried from placement.

    In addition, the ``GET /os-hypervisors/statistics`` API, which provided a
    summary view with just the fields listed above, has been removed entirely
    and will now raise a HTTP 404 with microversion 2.88 or greater.

    Finally, the ``GET /os-hypervisors/{hypervisor}/uptime`` API, which
    provided a similar response to the ``GET /os-hypervisors/{hypervisor}`` API
    but with an additional ``uptime`` field, has been removed in favour of
    including this field in the primary ``GET /os-hypervisors/{hypervisor}``
    API.
