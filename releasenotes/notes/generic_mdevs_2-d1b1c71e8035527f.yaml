    A new configuration option is now available for supporting PCI devices that
    use the `VFIO-mdev`_ kernel framework and are stateless. Instead of using
    the ``VGPU`` resource class for both the inventory and the related
    allocations, the operator could ask to use another custom resource class
    for a specific mdev type by using the dynamic ``mdev_class``.
