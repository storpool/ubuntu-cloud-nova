    Fixes slow compute restart when using the ``nova.virt.ironic`` compute
    driver where the driver was previously attempting to attach VIFS on
    start-up via the ``plug_vifs`` driver method. This method has grown
    otherwise unused since the introduction of the ``attach_interface``
    method of attaching VIFs. As Ironic manages the attachment of VIFs to
    baremetal nodes in order to align with the security requirements of a
    physical baremetal node's lifecycle. The ironic driver now ignores calls
    to the ``plug_vifs`` method.
