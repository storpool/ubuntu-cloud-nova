fixes:
  - |
    Previously, it was possible to specify values for the
    ``hw:cpu_realtime_mask`` extra spec that were not within the range of valid
    instances cores. This value is now correctly validated.
features:
  - |
    It is now possible to allocate all cores in an instance to realtime and
    omit the ``hw:cpu_realtime_mask`` extra spec. This requires specifying the
    ``hw:emulator_threads_policy`` extra spec.
  - |
    It is now possible to specify a mask in ``hw:cpu_realtime_mask`` without a
    leading ``^``. When this is ommitted, the value will specify the cores that
    should be included in the set of realtime cores, as opposed to those that
    should be excluded.
