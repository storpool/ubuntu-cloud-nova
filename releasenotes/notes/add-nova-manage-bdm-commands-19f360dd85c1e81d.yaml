    A number of commands have been managed to ``nova-manage`` to help update
    stale volume attachment connection info for a given volume and instance.

    * The ``nova-manage volume_attachment show`` command can be used to show
      the current volume attachment information for a given volume and
      instance.

    * The ``nova-manage volume_attachment get_connector`` command can
      be used to get updated host connector for the localhost.

    * Finally, the ``nova-manage volume_attachment refresh`` command can be
      used to update the volume attachment with this updated connection
      information.
