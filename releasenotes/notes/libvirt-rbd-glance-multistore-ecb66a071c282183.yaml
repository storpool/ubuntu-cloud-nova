    The libvirt RBD image backend module can now handle a Glance
    multistore environment where multiple RBD clusters are in use
    across a single Nova/Glance deployment, configured as independent
    Glance stores. In the case where an instance is booted with an
    image that does not exist in the RBD cluster that Nova is
    configured to use, Nova can ask Glance to copy the image from
    whatever store it is currently in to the one that represents its
    RBD cluster. To enable this feature, set
    ``[libvirt]/images_rbd_glance_store_name`` to tell Nova the Glance
    store name of the RBD cluster it uses.
