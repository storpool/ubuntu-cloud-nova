    A new PCI NUMA affinity policy is available. The
    ``hw:pci_numa_affinity_policy`` flavor extra spec and
    ``hw_pci_numa_affinity_policy`` image metadata property now accept a
    ``socket`` policy value. This value indicates that the PCI device must be
    affined to the same host socket as at least one of the guest NUMA nodes.
    For more information, see the `PCI Passthrough`__ guide.
