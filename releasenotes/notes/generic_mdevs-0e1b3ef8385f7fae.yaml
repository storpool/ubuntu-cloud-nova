deprecations:
  - |
    The existing config options in the ``[devices]`` group for managing virtual
    GPUs are now renamed in order to be more generic since the mediated devices
    framework from the linux kernel can support other devices:

    - ``enabled_vgpu_types`` is now deprecated in favour of
      ``enabled_mdev_types``
    - Dynamic configuration groups called ``[vgpu_*]`` are now deprecated in
      favour of ``[mdev_*]``

    Support for the deprecated options will be removed in a future release.
