    As a fix for `bug 1942329 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1942329>`_
    nova now updates the MAC address of the ``direct-physical`` ports during
    mova operations to reflect the MAC address of the physical device on the
    destination host. Those servers that were created before this fix need to be
    moved or the port needs to be detached and the re-attached to synchronize the
    MAC address.
