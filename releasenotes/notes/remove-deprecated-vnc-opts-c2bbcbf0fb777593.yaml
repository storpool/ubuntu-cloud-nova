    vnc-related config options were deprecated in Pike release and now has been
    removed:

    - ``vncserver_listen`` opt removed, now we use only server_listen to bind
      vnc address opt.
    - ``vncserver_proxyclient_address`` opt removed, now we use only
      server_proxyclient_address opt.
