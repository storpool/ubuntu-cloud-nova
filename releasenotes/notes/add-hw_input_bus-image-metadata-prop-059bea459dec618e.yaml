    A new image metadata property, ``hw_input_bus``, has been added. This
    allows you to specify the bus used for input devices - a pointer and
    keyboard - which are attached to the instance when graphics are enabled
    on compute nodes using the libvirt virt driver. Two values are currently
    accepted: ``usb`` and ``virtio``. This image metadata property effectively
    replaced the ``hw_pointer_model`` image metadata property, which is
    nontheless retained for backwards compatibility purposes.
