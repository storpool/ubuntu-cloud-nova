=================
Attaching Volumes
=================

The following sequence diagram outlines the current flow when attaching a
volume to an instance using the ``os-volume_attachments`` API. This diagram
uses the ``libvirt`` driver as an example virt driver to additionally document
the optional interactions with the ``os-brick`` library on the compute hosts
during the request.

.. note:: ``os-brick`` is not always used to connect volumes to the host, most
           notibly when connecting an instance natively to ceph ``rbd`` volumes

The diagram also outlines the various locks taken on the compute during the
attach volume flow. In this example these include locks against the
``instance.uuid``, ``cinder_backend.uuid`` orchestrated for ``nova-compute`` by
``os-brick`` and the generic ``connect_volume`` lock taken within os-brick
itself. This final ``connect_volume`` lock also being held when detaching and
disconnecting a volume from the host by ``os-brick``.
