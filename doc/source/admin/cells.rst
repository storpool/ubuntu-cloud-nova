Cells (v2)
==========

.. versionadded:: 16.0.0 (Pike)

This document describes the layout of a deployment with cells v2, including
deployment considerations for security and scale and recommended practices and
tips for running and maintaining cells v2 for admins and operators. It is
focused on code present in Pike and later, and while it is geared towards
people who want to have multiple cells for whatever reason, the nature of the
cells v2 support in Nova means that it applies in some way to all deployments.

Before reading any further, there is a nice overview presentation_ that Andrew
Laski gave at the Austin (Newton) summit which may be worth watching.

.. note::

   Cells v2 is different to the cells feature found in earlier versions of
   nova, also known as cells v1. Cells v1 was deprecated in 16.0.0 (Pike) and
   removed entirely in Train (20.0.0).


Overview
--------

The purpose of the cells functionality in nova is to allow larger deployments
to shard their many compute nodes into cells. All nova deployments are by
definition cells deployments, even if most will only ever have a single cell.
This means a multi-cell deployment will not b radically different from a
"standard" nova deployment.

Consider such a deployment. It will consists of the following components:

- The :program:`nova-api` service which provides the external REST API to
  users.

- The :program:`nova-scheduler` and ``placement`` services which are
  responsible for tracking resources and deciding which compute node instances
  should be on.

- An "API database" that is used primarily by :program:`nova-api` and
  :program:`nova-scheduler` (called *API-level services* below) to track
  location information about instances, as well as a temporary location for
  instances being built but not yet scheduled.

- The :program:`nova-conductor` service which offloads long-running tasks for
  the API-level services and insulates compute nodes from direct database access

- The :program:`nova-compute` service which manages the virt driver and
  hypervisor host.

- A "cell database" which is used by API, conductor and compute
  services, and which houses the majority of the information about
  instances.

- A "cell0 database" which is just like the cell database, but
  contains only instances that failed to be scheduled. This database mimics a
  regular cell, but has no compute nodes and is used only as a place to put
  instances that fail to land on a real compute node (and thus a real cell).

- A message queue which allows the services to communicate with each
  other via RPC.

In smaller deployments, there will typically be a single message queue that all
services share and a single database server which hosts the API database, a
single cell database, as well as the required cell0 database. Because we only
have one "real" cell, we consider this a "single-cell deployment".

In larger deployments, we can opt to shard the deployment using multiple cells.
In this configuration there will still only be one global API database but
there will be a cell database (where the bulk of the instance information
lives) for each cell, each containing a portion of the instances for the entire
deployment within, as well as per-cell message queues and per-cell
:program:`nova-conductor` instances. There will also be an additional
:program:`nova-conductor` instance, known as a *super conductor*, to handle
API-level operations.

In these larger deployments, each of the nova services will use a cell-specific
configuration file, all of which will at a minimum specify a message queue
endpoint (i.e. :oslo.config:option:`transport_url`). Most of the services will
also contain database connection configuration information (i.e.
:oslo.config:option:`database.connection`), while API-level services that need
access to the global routing and placement information will also be configured
to reach the API database (i.e. :oslo.config:option:`api_database.connection`).

.. note::

   The pair of :oslo.config:option:`transport_url` and
   :oslo.config:option:`database.connection` configured for a service defines
   what cell a service lives in.

API-level services need to be able to contact other services in all of
the cells. Since they only have one configured
:oslo.config:option:`transport_url` and
:oslo.config:option:`database.connection`, they look up the information for the
other cells in the API database, with records called *cell mappings*.

.. note::

   The API database must have cell mapping records that match
   the :oslo.config:option:`transport_url` and
   :oslo.config:option:`database.connection` configuration options of the
   lower-level services. See the ``nova-manage`` :ref:`man-page-cells-v2`
   commands for more information about how to create and examine these records.

The following section goes into more detail about the difference between
single-cell and multi-cell deployments.


Service layout
--------------

The services generally have a well-defined communication pattern that
dictates their layout in a deployment. In a small/simple scenario, the
rules do not have much of an impact as all the services can
communicate with each other on a single message bus and in a single
cell database. However, as the deployment grows, scaling and security
concerns may drive separation and isolation of the services.

Single cell
~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a diagram of the basic services that a simple (single-cell) deployment
would have, as well as the relationships (i.e. communication paths) between
them:

.. graphviz::

  digraph services {
    graph [pad="0.35", ranksep="0.65", nodesep="0.55", concentrate=true];
    node [fontsize=10 fontname="Monospace"];
    edge [arrowhead="normal", arrowsize="0.8"];
    labelloc=bottom;
    labeljust=left;

    { rank=same
      api [label="nova-api"]
      apidb [label="API Database" shape="box"]
      scheduler [label="nova-scheduler"]
    }
    { rank=same
      mq [label="MQ" shape="diamond"]
      conductor [label="nova-conductor"]
    }
    { rank=same
      cell0db [label="Cell0 Database" shape="box"]
      celldb [label="Cell Database" shape="box"]
      compute [label="nova-compute"]
    }

    api -> mq -> compute
    conductor -> mq -> scheduler

    api -> apidb
    api -> cell0db
    api -> celldb

    conductor -> apidb
    conductor -> cell0db
    conductor -> celldb
  }

All of the services are configured to talk to each other over the same
message bus, and there is only one cell database where live instance
data resides. The cell0 database is present (and required) but as no
compute nodes are connected to it, this is still a "single cell"
deployment.

Multiple cells
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to shard the services into multiple cells, a number of things
must happen. First, the message bus must be split into pieces along
the same lines as the cell database. Second, a dedicated conductor
must be run for the API-level services, with access to the API
database and a dedicated message queue. We call this *super conductor*
to distinguish its place and purpose from the per-cell conductor nodes.

.. graphviz::

  digraph services2 {
    graph [pad="0.35", ranksep="0.65", nodesep="0.55", concentrate=true];
    node [fontsize=10 fontname="Monospace"];
    edge [arrowhead="normal", arrowsize="0.8"];
    labelloc=bottom;
    labeljust=left;

    subgraph api {
      api [label="nova-api"]
      scheduler [label="nova-scheduler"]
      conductor [label="super conductor"]
      { rank=same
        apimq [label="API MQ" shape="diamond"]
        apidb [label="API Database" shape="box"]
      }

      api -> apimq -> conductor
      api -> apidb
      conductor -> apimq -> scheduler
      conductor -> apidb
    }

    subgraph clustercell0 {
      label="Cell 0"
      color=green
      cell0db [label="Cell Database" shape="box"]
    }

    subgraph clustercell1 {
      label="Cell 1"
      color=blue
      mq1 [label="Cell MQ" shape="diamond"]
      cell1db [label="Cell Database" shape="box"]
      conductor1 [label="nova-conductor"]
      compute1 [label="nova-compute"]

      conductor1 -> mq1 -> compute1
      conductor1 -> cell1db

    }

    subgraph clustercell2 {
      label="Cell 2"
      color=red
      mq2 [label="Cell MQ" shape="diamond"]
      cell2db [label="Cell Database" shape="box"]
      conductor2 [label="nova-conductor"]
      compute2 [label="nova-compute"]

      conductor2 -> mq2 -> compute2
      conductor2 -> cell2db
    }

    api -> mq1 -> conductor1
    api -> mq2 -> conductor2
    api -> cell0db
    api -> cell1db
    api -> cell2db

    conductor -> cell0db
    conductor -> cell1db
    conductor -> mq1
    conductor -> cell2db
    conductor -> mq2
  }

It is important to note that services in the lower cell boxes only
have the ability to call back to the placement API but cannot access
any other API-layer services via RPC, nor do they have access to the
API database for global visibility of resources across the cloud.
This is intentional and provides security and failure domain
isolation benefits, but also has impacts on some things that would
otherwise require this any-to-any communication style. Check :ref:`upcall`
below for the most up-to-date information about any caveats that may be present
due to this limitation.


Database layout
---------------

As mentioned previously, there is a split between global data and data that is
local to a cell. These databases schema are referred to as the *API* and *main*
database schemas, respectively.

API database
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The API database is the database used for API-level services, such as
:program:`nova-api` and, in a multi-cell deployment, the superconductor.
The models and migrations related to this database can be found in
``nova.db.api``, and the database can be managed using the
:program:`nova-manage api_db` commands.

Main (cell-level) database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main database is the database used for cell-level :program:`nova-conductor`
instances. The models and migrations related to this database can be found in
``nova.db.main``, and the database can be managed using the
:program:`nova-manage db` commands.


Usage
-----

As noted previously, all deployments are in effect now cells v2 deployments. As
a result, setup of any nova deployment - even those that intend to only have
one cell - will involve some level of cells configuration. These changes are
configuration-related, both in the main nova configuration file as well as some
extra records in the databases.

All nova deployments must now have the following databases available
and configured:

1. The "API" database
2. One special "cell" database called "cell0"
3. One (or eventually more) "cell" databases

Thus, a small nova deployment will have an API database, a cell0, and
what we will call here a "cell1" database. High-level tracking
information is kept in the API database. Instances that are never
scheduled are relegated to the cell0 database, which is effectively a
graveyard of instances that failed to start. All successful/running
instances are stored in "cell1".

.. note::

   Since Nova services make use of both configuration file and some
   databases records, starting or restarting those services with an
   incomplete configuration could lead to an incorrect deployment.
   Only restart the services once you are done with the described
   steps below.

.. note::

   The following examples show the full expanded command line usage of
   the setup commands. This is to make it easier to visualize which of
   the various URLs are used by each of the commands. However, you should be
   able to put all of that in the config file and :program:`nova-manage` will
   use those values. If need be, you can create separate config files and pass
   them as ``nova-manage --config-file foo.conf`` to control the behavior
   without specifying things on the command lines.

Configuring a new deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are installing Nova for the first time and have no compute hosts in the
database yet then it will be necessary to configure cell0 and at least one
additional "real" cell. To begin, ensure your API database schema has been
populated using the :program:`nova-manage api_db sync` command. Ensure the
connection information for this database is stored in the ``nova.conf`` file
using the :oslo.config:option:`api_database.connection` config option:

.. code-block:: ini

   [api_database]
   connection = mysql+pymysql://root:secretmysql@dbserver/nova_api?charset=utf8

Since there may be multiple "cell" databases (and in fact everyone
will have cell0 and cell1 at a minimum), connection info for these is
stored in the API database. Thus, the API database must exist and must provide
information on how to connect to it before continuing to the steps below, so
that :program:`nova-manage` can find your other databases.

Next, we will create the necessary records for the cell0 database. To
do that we will first use :program:`nova-manage cell_v2 map_cell0` to create
and map cell0. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ nova-manage cell_v2 map_cell0 \
       --database_connection mysql+pymysql://root:secretmysql@dbserver/nova_cell0?charset=utf8

.. note::

   If you don't specify ``--database_connection`` then the commands will use
   the :oslo.config:option:`database.connection` value from your config file
   and mangle the database name to have a ``_cell0`` suffix

.. warning::

   If your databases are on separate hosts then you should specify
   ``--database_connection`` or make certain that the :file:`nova.conf`
   being used has the :oslo.config:option:`database.connection` value pointing
   to the same user/password/host that will work for the cell0 database.
   If the cell0 mapping was created incorrectly, it can be deleted
   using the :program:`nova-manage cell_v2 delete_cell` command before running
   :program:`nova-manage cell_v2 map_cell0` again with the proper database
   connection value.

We will then use :program:`nova-manage db sync` to apply the database schema to
this new database. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ nova-manage db sync \
       --database_connection mysql+pymysql://root:secretmysql@dbserver/nova_cell0?charset=utf8

Since no hosts are ever in cell0, nothing further is required for its setup.
Note that all deployments only ever have one cell0, as it is special, so once
you have done this step you never need to do it again, even if you add more
regular cells.

Now, we must create another cell which will be our first "regular"
cell, which has actual compute hosts in it, and to which instances can
actually be scheduled. First, we create the cell record using
:program:`nova-manage cell_v2 create_cell`. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ nova-manage cell_v2 create_cell \
      --name cell1 \
      --database_connection  mysql+pymysql://root:secretmysql@127.0.0.1/nova?charset=utf8 \
      --transport-url rabbit://stackrabbit:secretrabbit@mqserver:5672/

.. note::

   If you don't specify the database and transport urls then
   :program:`nova-manage` will use the :oslo.config:option:`transport_url` and
   :oslo.config:option:`database.connection` values from the config file.

.. note::

   It is a good idea to specify a name for the new cell you create so you can
   easily look up cell UUIDs with the :program:`nova-manage cell_v2 list_cells`
   command later if needed.

.. note::

   The :program:`nova-manage cell_v2 create_cell` command will print the UUID
   of the newly-created cell if ``--verbose`` is passed, which is useful if you
   need to run commands like :program:`nova-manage cell_v2 discover_hosts`
   targeted at a specific cell.

At this point, the API database can now find the cell database, and further
commands will attempt to look inside. If this is a completely fresh database
(such as if you're adding a cell, or if this is a new deployment), then you
will need to run :program:`nova-manage db sync` on it to initialize the
schema.

Now we have a cell, but no hosts are in it which means the scheduler will never
actually place instances there. The next step is to scan the database for
compute node records and add them into the cell we just created. For this step,
you must have had a compute node started such that it registers itself as a
running service. You can identify this using the :program:`openstack compute
service list` command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ openstack compute service list --service nova-compute

Once that has happened, you can scan and add it to the cell using the
:program:`nova-manage cell_v2 discover_hosts` command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ nova-manage cell_v2 discover_hosts

This command will connect to any databases for which you have created cells (as
above), look for hosts that have registered themselves there, and map those
hosts in the API database so that they are visible to the scheduler as
available targets for instances. Any time you add more compute hosts to a cell,
you need to re-run this command to map them from the top-level so they can be
utilized. You can also configure a periodic task to have Nova discover new
hosts automatically by setting the
:oslo.config:option:`scheduler.discover_hosts_in_cells_interval` to a time
interval in seconds. The periodic task is run by the :program:`nova-scheduler`
service, so you must be sure to configure it on all of your
:program:`nova-scheduler` hosts.

.. note::

   In the future, whenever you add new compute hosts, you will need to run the
   :program:`nova-manage cell_v2 discover_hosts` command after starting them to
   map them to the cell if you did not configure automatic host discovery using
   :oslo.config:option:`scheduler.discover_hosts_in_cells_interval`.

Adding a new cell to an existing deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add additional cells to your deployment using the same steps used above
to create your first cell. We can create a new cell record using
:program:`nova-manage cell_v2 create_cell`. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ nova-manage cell_v2 create_cell \
      --name cell2 \
      --database_connection  mysql+pymysql://root:secretmysql@127.0.0.1/nova?charset=utf8 \
      --transport-url rabbit://stackrabbit:secretrabbit@mqserver:5672/

.. note::

   If you don't specify the database and transport urls then
   :program:`nova-manage` will use the :oslo.config:option:`transport_url` and
   :oslo.config:option:`database.connection` values from the config file.

.. note::

   It is a good idea to specify a name for the new cell you create so you can
   easily look up cell UUIDs with the :program:`nova-manage cell_v2 list_cells`
   command later if needed.

.. note::

   The :program:`nova-manage cell_v2 create_cell` command will print the UUID
   of the newly-created cell if ``--verbose`` is passed, which is useful if you
   need to run commands like :program:`nova-manage cell_v2 discover_hosts`
   targeted at a specific cell.

You can repeat this step for each cell you wish to add to your deployment. Your
existing cell database will be re-used - this simply informs the top-level API
database about your existing cell databases.

Once you've created your new cell, use :program:`nova-manage cell_v2
discover_hosts` to map compute hosts to cells. This is only necessary if you
haven't enabled automatic discovery using the
:oslo.config:option:`scheduler.discover_hosts_in_cells_interval` option. For
example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ nova-manage cell_v2 discover_hosts

.. note::

   This command will search for compute hosts in each cell database and map
   them to the corresponding cell. This can be slow, particularly for larger
   deployments. You may wish to specify the ``--cell_uuid`` option, which will
   limit the search to a specific cell. You can use the :program:`nova-manage
   cell_v2 list_cells` command to look up cell UUIDs if you are going to
   specify ``--cell_uuid``.

Finally, run the :program:`nova-manage cell_v2 map_instances` command to map
existing instances to the new cell(s). For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ nova-manage cell_v2 map_instances

.. note::

   This command will search for instances in each cell database and map them to
   the correct cell. This can be slow, particularly for larger deployments. You
   may wish to specify the ``--cell_uuid`` option, which will limit the search
   to a specific cell. You can use the :program:`nova-manage cell_v2
   list_cells` command to look up cell UUIDs if you are going to specify
   ``--cell_uuid``.

.. note::

   The ``--max-count`` option can be specified if you would like to limit the
   number of instances to map in a single run. If ``--max-count`` is not
   specified, all instances will be mapped. Repeated runs of the command will
   start from where the last run finished so it is not necessary to increase
   ``--max-count`` to finish. An exit code of 0 indicates that all instances
   have been mapped. An exit code of 1 indicates that there are remaining
   instances that need to be mapped.

Template URLs in Cell Mappings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in the 18.0.0 (Rocky) release, the URLs provided in the cell mappings
for ``--database_connection`` and ``--transport-url`` can contain
variables which are evaluated each time they are loaded from the
database, and the values of which are taken from the corresponding
base options in the host's configuration file.  The base URL is parsed
and the following elements may be substituted into the cell mapping
URL (using ``rabbit://bob:s3kret@myhost:123/nova?sync=true#extra``):

.. list-table:: Cell Mapping URL Variables
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15, 50, 15

   * - Variable
     - Meaning
     - Part of example URL
   * - ``scheme``
     - The part before the `://`
     - ``rabbit``
   * - ``username``
     - The username part of the credentials
     - ``bob``
   * - ``password``
     - The password part of the credentials
     - ``s3kret``
   * - ``hostname``
     - The hostname or address
     - ``myhost``
   * - ``port``
     - The port number (must be specified)
     - ``123``
   * - ``path``
     - The "path" part of the URL (without leading slash)
     - ``nova``
   * - ``query``
     - The full query string arguments (without leading question mark)
     - ``sync=true``
   * - ``fragment``
     - Everything after the first hash mark
     - ``extra``

Variables are provided in curly brackets, like ``{username}``. A simple template
of ``rabbit://{username}:{password}@otherhost/{path}`` will generate a full URL
of ``rabbit://bob:s3kret@otherhost/nova`` when used with the above example.

.. note::

   The :oslo.config:option:`database.connection` and
   :oslo.config:option:`transport_url` values are not reloaded from the
   configuration file during a SIGHUP, which means that a full service restart
   will be required to notice changes in a cell mapping record if variables are
   changed.

.. note::

   The :oslo.config:option:`transport_url` option can contain an
   extended syntax for the "netloc" part of the URL
   (i.e. ``userA:passwordA@hostA:portA,userB:passwordB:hostB:portB``). In this
   case, substitions of the form ``username1``, ``username2``, etc will be
   honored and can be used in the template URL.

The templating of these URLs may be helpful in order to provide each service host
with its own credentials for, say, the database. Without templating, all hosts
will use the same URL (and thus credentials) for accessing services like the
database and message queue. By using a URL with a template that results in the
credentials being taken from the host-local configuration file, each host will
use different values for those connections.

Assuming you have two service hosts that are normally configured with the cell0
database as their primary connection, their (abbreviated) configurations would
look like this:

.. code-block:: ini

  [database]
  connection = mysql+pymysql://service1:foo@myapidbhost/nova_cell0

and:

.. code-block:: ini

   [database]
   connection = mysql+pymysql://service2:bar@myapidbhost/nova_cell0

Without cell mapping template URLs, they would still use the same credentials
(as stored in the mapping) to connect to the cell databases. However, consider
template URLs like the following::

    mysql+pymysql://{username}:{password}@mycell1dbhost/nova

and::

    mysql+pymysql://{username}:{password}@mycell2dbhost/nova

Using the first service and cell1 mapping, the calculated URL that will actually
be used for connecting to that database will be::

    mysql+pymysql://service1:foo@mycell1dbhost/nova


Design
------

Prior to the introduction of cells v2, when a request hit the Nova API for a
particular instance, the instance information was fetched from the database.
The information contained the hostname of the compute node on which the
instance was currently located. If the request needed to take action on the
instance (which it generally would), the hostname was used to calculate the
name of a queue and a message was written there which would eventually find its
way to the proper compute node.

The meat of the cells v2 feature was to split this hostname lookup into two parts
that yielded three pieces of information instead of one. Basically, instead of
merely looking up the *name* of the compute node on which an instance was
located, we also started obtaining database and queue connection information.
Thus, when asked to take action on instance $foo, we now:

1. Lookup the three-tuple of (database, queue, hostname) for that instance
2. Connect to that database and fetch the instance record
3. Connect to the queue and send the message to the proper hostname queue

The above differs from the previous organization in two ways. First, we now
need to do two database lookups before we know where the instance lives.
Second, we need to demand-connect to the appropriate database and queue. Both
of these changes had performance implications, but it was possible to mitigate
them through the use of things like a memcache of instance mapping information
and pooling of connections to database and queue systems. The number of cells
will always be much smaller than the number of instances.

There were also availability implications with the new feature since something like a
instance list which might query multiple cells could end up with a partial result
if there is a database failure in a cell. These issues can be mitigated, as
discussed in :ref:`handling-cell-failures`. A database failure within a cell
would cause larger issues than a partial list result so the expectation is that
it would be addressed quickly and cells v2 will handle it by indicating in the
response that the data may not be complete.


Comparison with cells v1
------------------------

Prior to the introduction of cells v2, nova had a very similar feature, also
called cells or referred to as cells v1 for disambiguation. Cells v2 was an
effort to address many of the perceived shortcomings of the cell v1 feature.
Benefits of the cells v2 feature over the previous cells v1 feature include:

- Native sharding of the database and queue as a first-class-feature in nova.
  All of the code paths will go through the lookup procedure and thus we won't
  have the same feature parity issues as we do with current cells.

- No high-level replication of all the cell databases at the top. The API will
  need a database of its own for things like the instance index, but it will
  not need to replicate all the data at the top level.

- It draws a clear line between global and local data elements. Things like
  flavors and keypairs are clearly global concepts that need only live at the
  top level. Providing this separation allows compute nodes to become even more
  stateless and insulated from things like deleted/changed global data.

- Existing non-cells users will suddenly gain the ability to spawn a new "cell"
  from their existing deployment without changing their architecture. Simply
  adding information about the new database and queue systems to the new index
  will allow them to consume those resources.

- Existing cells users will need to fill out the cells mapping index, shutdown
  their existing cells synchronization service, and ultimately clean up their
  top level database. However, since the high-level organization is not
  substantially different, they will not have to re-architect their systems to
  move to cells v2.

- Adding new sets of hosts as a new "cell" allows them to be plugged into a
  deployment and tested before allowing builds to be scheduled to them.


.. _cells-v2-caveats:

Caveats
-------

.. note::

   Many of these caveats have been addressed since the introduction of cells v2
   in the 16.0.0 (Pike) release. These are called out below.

Cross-cell move operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for cross-cell cold migration and resize was introduced in the 21.0.0
(Ussuri) release. This is documented in
:doc:`/admin/configuration/cross-cell-resize`. Prior to this release, it was
not possible to cold migrate or resize an instance from a host in one cell to a
host in another cell.

It is not currently possible to live migrate, evacuate or unshelve an instance
from a host in one cell to a host in another cell.

Quota-related quirks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Quotas are now calculated live at the point at which an operation
would consume more resource, instead of being kept statically in the
database. This means that a multi-cell environment may incorrectly
calculate the usage of a tenant if one of the cells is unreachable, as
those resources cannot be counted. In this case, the tenant may be
able to consume more resource from one of the available cells, putting
them far over quota when the unreachable cell returns.

.. note::

   Starting in the Train (20.0.0) release, it is possible to configure
   counting of quota usage from the placement service and API database
   to make quota usage calculations resilient to down or poor-performing
   cells in a multi-cell environment. See the :doc:`quotas documentation
   </user/quotas>` for more details.

Performance of listing instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prior to the 17.0.0 (Queens) release, the instance list operation may not sort
and paginate results properly when crossing multiple cell boundaries. Further,
the performance of a sorted list operation across multiple cells was
considerably slower than with a single cell. This was resolved as part of the
`efficient-multi-cell-instance-list-and-sort`__ spec.

.. __: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/efficient-multi-cell-instance-list-and-sort

Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With a multi-cell environment with multiple message queues, it is
likely that operators will want to configure a separate connection to
a unified queue for notifications. This can be done in the configuration file
of all nodes. Refer to the :oslo.messaging-doc:`oslo.messaging configuration
documentation
<configuration/opts.html#oslo_messaging_notifications.transport_url>` for more
details.

.. _cells-v2-layout-metadata-api:

Nova Metadata API service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting from the 19.0.0 (Stein) release, the :doc:`nova metadata API service
</admin/metadata-service>` can be run either globally or per cell using the
:oslo.config:option:`api.local_metadata_per_cell` configuration option.

.. rubric:: Global

If you have networks that span cells, you might need to run Nova metadata API
globally. When running globally, it should be configured as an API-level
service with access to the :oslo.config:option:`api_database.connection`
information. The nova metadata API service **must not** be run as a standalone
service, using the :program:`nova-api-metadata` service, in this case.

.. rubric:: Local per cell

Running Nova metadata API per cell can have better performance and data
isolation in a multi-cell deployment. If your networks are segmented along
cell boundaries, then you can run Nova metadata API service per cell. If you
choose to run it per cell, you should also configure each
:neutron-doc:`neutron-metadata-agent
<configuration/metadata-agent.html?#DEFAULT.nova_metadata_host>` service to
point to the corresponding :program:`nova-api-metadata`. The nova metadata API
service **must** be run as a standalone service, using the
:program:`nova-api-metadata` service, in this case.

Console proxies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting from the 18.0.0 (Rocky) release, console proxies must be run per cell
because console token authorizations are stored in cell databases. This means
that each console proxy server must have access to the
:oslo.config:option:`database.connection` information for the cell database
containing the instances for which it is proxying console access. This
functionality was added as part of the `convert-consoles-to-objects`__ spec.

.. __: https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/rocky/implemented/convert-consoles-to-objects.html

.. _upcall:

Operations requiring upcalls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you deploy multiple cells with a superconductor as described above,
computes and cell-based conductors will not have the ability to speak
to the scheduler as they are not connected to the same MQ. This is by
design for isolation, but currently the processes are not in place to
implement some features without such connectivity. Thus, anything that
requires a so-called "upcall" will not function. This impacts the
following:

#. Instance reschedules during boot and resize (part 1)

   .. note::

      This has been resolved in the `Queens release`__.

      .. __: https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/queens/approved/return-alternate-hosts.html

#. Instance affinity reporting from the compute nodes to scheduler
#. The late anti-affinity check during server create and evacuate
#. Querying host aggregates from the cell

   .. note::

      This has been resolved in the `Rocky release`__.

      .. __: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/live-migration-in-xapi-pool

#. Attaching a volume and ``[cinder] cross_az_attach = False``
#. Instance reschedules during boot and resize (part 2)

   .. note:: This has been resolved in the `Ussuri release`__.

      .. __: https://review.opendev.org/q/topic:bug/1781286

The first is simple: if you boot an instance, it gets scheduled to a
compute node, fails, it would normally be re-scheduled to another
node. That requires scheduler intervention and thus it will not work
in Pike with a multi-cell layout. If you do not rely on reschedules
for covering up transient compute-node failures, then this will not
affect you. To ensure you do not make futile attempts at rescheduling,
you should set :oslo.config:option:`scheduler.max_attempts` to ``1`` in
``nova.conf``.

The second two are related. The summary is that some of the facilities
that Nova has for ensuring that affinity/anti-affinity is preserved
between instances does not function in Pike with a multi-cell
layout. If you don't use affinity operations, then this will not
affect you. To make sure you don't make futile attempts at the
affinity check, you should set
:oslo.config:option:`workarounds.disable_group_policy_check_upcall` to ``True``
and :oslo.config:option:`filter_scheduler.track_instance_changes` to ``False``
in ``nova.conf``.

The fourth was previously only a problem when performing live migrations using
the since-removed XenAPI driver and not specifying ``--block-migrate``. The
driver would attempt to figure out if block migration should be performed based
on source and destination hosts being in the same aggregate. Since aggregates
data had migrated to the API database, the cell conductor would not be able to
access the aggregate information and would fail.

The fifth is a problem because when a volume is attached to an instance
in the *nova-compute* service, and ``[cinder]/cross_az_attach=False`` in
nova.conf, we attempt to look up the availability zone that the instance is
in which includes getting any host aggregates that the ``instance.host`` is in.
Since the aggregates are in the API database and the cell conductor cannot
access that information, so this will fail. In the future this check could be
moved to the *nova-api* service such that the availability zone between the
instance and the volume is checked before we reach the cell, except in the
case of :term:`boot from volume <Boot From Volume>` where the *nova-compute*
service itself creates the volume and must tell Cinder in which availability
zone to create the volume. Long-term, volume creation during boot from volume
should be moved to the top-level superconductor which would eliminate this AZ
up-call check problem.

The sixth is detailed in `bug 1781286`__ and is similar to the first issue.
The issue is that servers created without a specific availability zone
will have their AZ calculated during a reschedule based on the alternate host
selected. Determining the AZ for the alternate host requires an "up call" to
the API DB.

.. _handling-cell-failures:

Handling cell failures
----------------------

For an explanation on how ``nova-api`` handles cell failures please see the
`Handling Down Cells`__ section of the Compute API guide. Below, you can find
some recommended practices and considerations for effectively tolerating cell
failure situations.

.. __: https://docs.openstack.org/api-guide/compute/down_cells.html

Configuration considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since a cell being reachable or not is determined through timeouts, it is suggested
to provide suitable values for the following settings based on your requirements.

#. :oslo.config:option:`database.max_retries` is 10 by default meaning every time
   a cell becomes unreachable, it would retry 10 times before nova can declare the
   cell as a "down" cell.
#. :oslo.config:option:`database.retry_interval` is 10 seconds and
   :oslo.config:option:`oslo_messaging_rabbit.rabbit_retry_interval` is 1 second by
   default meaning every time a cell becomes unreachable it would retry every 10
   seconds or 1 second depending on if it's a database or a message queue problem.
#. Nova also has a timeout value called ``CELL_TIMEOUT`` which is hardcoded to 60
   seconds and that is the total time the nova-api would wait before returning
   partial results for the "down" cells.

The values of the above settings will affect the time required for nova to decide
if a cell is unreachable and then take the necessary actions like returning
partial results.

The operator can also control the results of certain actions like listing
servers and services depending on the value of the
:oslo.config:option:`api.list_records_by_skipping_down_cells` config option.
If this is true, the results from the unreachable cells will be skipped
and if it is false, the request will just fail with an API error in situations where
partial constructs cannot be computed.

Disabling down cells
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the temporary outage in the infrastructure is being fixed, the affected
cells can be disabled so that they are removed from being scheduling candidates.
To enable or disable a cell, use :command:`nova-manage cell_v2 update_cell
--cell_uuid <cell_uuid> --disable`. See the :ref:`man-page-cells-v2` man page
for details on command usage.

Known issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Services and Performance:** In case a cell is down during the startup of nova
   services, there is the chance that the services hang because of not being able
   to connect to all the cell databases that might be required for certain calculations
   and initializations. An example scenario of this situation is if
   :oslo.config:option:`upgrade_levels.compute` is set to ``auto`` then the
   ``nova-api`` service hangs on startup if there is at least one unreachable
   cell. This is because it needs to connect to all the cells to gather
   information on each of the compute service's version to determine the compute
   version cap to use. The current workaround is to pin the
   :oslo.config:option:`upgrade_levels.compute` to a particular version like
   "rocky" and get the service up under such situations. See `bug 1815697`__
   for more details. Also note
   that in general during situations where cells are not reachable certain
   "slowness" may be experienced in operations requiring hitting all the cells
   because of the aforementioned configurable timeout/retry values.

.. _cells-counting-quotas:

2. **Counting Quotas:** Another known issue is in the current approach of counting
   quotas where we query each cell database to get the used resources and aggregate
   them which makes it sensitive to temporary cell outages. While the cell is
   unavailable, we cannot count resource usage residing in that cell database and
   things would behave as though more quota is available than should be. That is,
   if a tenant has used all of their quota and part of it is in cell A and cell A
   goes offline temporarily, that tenant will suddenly be able to allocate more
   resources than their limit (assuming cell A returns, the tenant will have more
   resources allocated than their allowed quota).

   .. note:: Starting in the Train (20.0.0) release, it is possible to
             configure counting of quota usage from the placement service and
             API database to make quota usage calculations resilient to down or
             poor-performing cells in a multi-cell environment. See the
             :doc:`quotas documentation</user/quotas>` for more details.

FAQs
----

- How do I find out which hosts are bound to which cell?

  There are a couple of ways to do this.

  #. Run :program:`nova-manage cell_v2 discover_hosts --verbose`.

     This does not produce a report but if you are trying to determine if a
     host is in a cell you can run this and it will report any hosts that are
     not yet mapped to a cell and map them. This command is idempotent.

  #. Run :program:`nova-manage cell_v2 list_hosts`.

     This will list hosts in all cells. If you want to list hosts in a
     specific cell, you can use the ``--cell_uuid`` option.

- I updated the ``database_connection`` and/or ``transport_url`` in a cell
  using the ``nova-manage cell_v2 update_cell`` command but the API is still
  trying to use the old settings.

  The cell mappings are cached in the :program:`nova-api` service worker so you
  will need to restart the worker process to rebuild the cache. Note that there
  is another global cache tied to request contexts, which is used in the
  nova-conductor and nova-scheduler services, so you might need to do the same
  if you are having the same issue in those services. As of the 16.0.0 (Pike)
  release there is no timer on the cache or hook to refresh the cache using a
  SIGHUP to the service.

- I have upgraded from Newton to Ocata and I can list instances but I get a
  HTTP 404 (NotFound) error when I try to get details on a specific instance.

  Instances need to be mapped to cells so the API knows which cell an instance
  lives in. When upgrading, the :program:`nova-manage cell_v2 simple_cell_setup`
  command will automatically map the instances to the single cell which is
  backed by the existing nova database. If you have already upgraded and did
  not use the :program:`nova-manage cell_v2 simple_cell_setup` command, you can run the
  :program:`nova-manage cell_v2 map_instances` command with the ``--cell_uuid``
  option to map all instances in the given cell. See the
  :ref:`man-page-cells-v2` man page for details on command usage.

- Can I create a cell but have it disabled from scheduling?

  Yes. It is possible to create a pre-disabled cell such that it does not
  become a candidate for scheduling new VMs. This can be done by running the
  :program:`nova-manage cell_v2 create_cell` command with the ``--disabled``
  option.

- How can I disable a cell so that the new server create requests do not go to
  it while I perform maintenance?

  Existing cells can be disabled by running :program:`nova-manage cell_v2
  update_cell` with the ``--disable`` option and can be re-enabled once the
  maintenance period is over by running this command with the ``--enable``
  option.

- I disabled (or enabled) a cell using the :program:`nova-manage cell_v2
  update_cell` or I created a new (pre-disabled) cell(mapping) using the
  :program:`nova-manage cell_v2 create_cell` command but the scheduler is still
  using the old settings.

  The cell mappings are cached in the scheduler worker so you will either need
  to restart the scheduler process to refresh the cache, or send a SIGHUP
  signal to the scheduler by which it will automatically refresh the cells
  cache and the changes will take effect.

- Why was the cells REST API not implemented for cells v2? Why are there no
  CRUD operations for cells in the API?

  One of the deployment challenges that cells v1 had was the requirement for
  the API and control services to be up before a new cell could be deployed.
  This was not a problem for large-scale public clouds that never shut down,
  but is not a reasonable requirement for smaller clouds that do offline
  upgrades and/or clouds which could be taken completely offline by something
  like a power outage. Initial devstack and gate testing for cells v1 was
  delayed by the need to engineer a solution for bringing the services
  partially online in order to deploy the rest, and this continues to be a gap
  for other deployment tools. Consider also the FFU case where the control
  plane needs to be down for a multi-release upgrade window where changes to
  cell records have to be made. This would be quite a bit harder if the way
  those changes are made is via the API, which must remain down during the
  process.

  Further, there is a long-term goal to move cell configuration (i.e.
  cell_mappings and the associated URLs and credentials) into config and get
  away from the need to store and provision those things in the database.
  Obviously a CRUD interface in the API would prevent us from making that move.

- Why are cells not exposed as a grouping mechanism in the API for listing
  services, instances, and other resources?

  Early in the design of cells v2 we set a goal to not let the cell concept
  leak out of the API, even for operators. Aggregates are the way nova supports
  grouping of hosts for a variety of reasons, and aggregates can cut across
  cells, and/or be aligned with them if desired. If we were to support cells as
  another grouping mechanism, we would likely end up having to implement many
  of the same features for them as aggregates, such as scheduler features,
  metadata, and other searching/filtering operations. Since aggregates are how
  Nova supports grouping, we expect operators to use aggregates any time they
  need to refer to a cell as a group of hosts from the API, and leave actual
  cells as a purely architectural detail.

  The need to filter instances by cell in the API can and should be solved by
  adding a generic by-aggregate filter, which would allow listing instances on
  hosts contained within any aggregate, including one that matches the cell
  boundaries if so desired.

- Why are the API responses for ``GET /servers``, ``GET /servers/detail``,
  ``GET /servers/{server_id}`` and ``GET /os-services`` missing some
  information for certain cells at certain times? Why do I see the status as
  "UNKNOWN" for the servers in those cells at those times when I run
  ``openstack server list`` or ``openstack server show``?

  Starting from microversion 2.69 the API responses of ``GET /servers``, ``GET
  /servers/detail``, ``GET /servers/{server_id}`` and ``GET /os-services`` may
  contain missing keys during down cell situations. See the `Handling Down
  Cells`__ section of the Compute API guide for more information on the partial
  constructs.

  For administrative considerations, see :ref:`handling-cell-failures`.
